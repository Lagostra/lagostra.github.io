## Hello World!

My name is Eivind Lie Andreassen, and I'm a Computer Science student at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, currently working on my Master's Thesis within Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, I am working with parallelization of Deep Learning, looking at methods for automatically finding efficient configurations for training a given neural network on multiple devices.

Feel free to check out my GitHub profile by using the link on the left of this page - it contains a large variety of projects of varying size and quality.
